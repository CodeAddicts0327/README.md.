###  Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hi! I'm Daniel from Philippines. I am a student from Refocus Academy and I really enjoy learning coding languanges. I was simply interested at first, however I realised I wanted to do it fulltime. 
Right now, I do it as my hobby and learn more about other languages, searching to know more about web development.
This year, I'd like to study more and internalize algorithms until I can solve any of the code problems without breaking a sweat. And hopefully I will build my own app.
When creating Web applications I know that I need to learn about Web development so  I want it to add as one of new skills and find a job, work whatever hours I want whenever I want.  
Thank you for visiting may GitHub!
